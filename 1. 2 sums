First time trying :
  2 for loop to loop in num list
  -> too time consuming when there're lots of numbers in list
Second time trying :
  -while loop
  -target number -1 loop to find the closest number to target number in num list
  -the difference of the closest number to the target number should be the second number,
   closest number should be the first number. If not, continue the process
  -> too time consuming when num = [50000, 1, 50000], target number = 100000
Third time trying :
  -calculate all the difference between numbers in list and the target number,
   arrange the numbers according to descending order of difference
  -find ( target number - n numbers ) in list
   n starting from 1
   -> if exist -> ends
   -> if not -> use the n + 1 number closest to target number
